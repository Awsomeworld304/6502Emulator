# 6502Emulator
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Awsomeworld304/6502Emulator)\
My intro into developing emulators as a whole.
## What is this?
It's a 6502 CPU Emulator with a matching bus and ram and whatnot.\
The purpose of this is to act like a base for other stuff like a C64 emulator or a NES emulator.
## Fatures
### Implemented
#### All Original Instructions
All of the original instructions have been added and work properly. (maybe)
#### Simple RAM
Just a simple RAM controller.\
It can load roms and such for the CPU to read.
### Planned
#### Illegal Instructions
I'm planning to add all the illegal instructions later down the line, but it requires more research.
